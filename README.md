# ðŸŽ© Observer

This project aims to support forcibly displaced individuals and animals in various ways,
including legal consulting, humanitarian support. It advocates for compassion and
understanding towards those affected by displacement and works towards creating a more just and equitable world for everyone.

## Example case

To get more context please read the following real world example (People and places are made up).

Let's say Lee had to flee his home country because of war now he is in Ukraine, he found an NGO and
activist group helping with accomodation and paperwork all displaced people and their private information
is stored in spreadsheet without any protection and it grew big, now all activities became hard to perform
so they created another spreadsheet and so on, also tracking provided support is stored in the same spreadsheets
without any automatic system to obtain and combine in a single view they have to manually gather information
they need about any person case by case.
